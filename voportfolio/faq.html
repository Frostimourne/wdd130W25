            <p>Please send me a message on <a href="https://www.fiverr.com/jam2759/read-your-voice-over-script">Fiverr.com</a> with your project proposals or questions, and I will respond as soon as I can.  I typically respond in less than 24 hours, but often much quicker!</p>

        <button class="accordion">Where are you located?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>I currently reside in the rocky mountains of Utah with my beautiful wife, darling daughter, and rascally rowdy dog</p>

            <div class="panel">
                <p>I currently provide audio only deliveries, as my home studio is not equipped for more than basic video calling from a cheap webcam</p>

            <button class="accordion">How fast can you deliver my audio? I need it yesterday!</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>You can typically expect shorter projects (less than 1000 words) to be delivered within a few days. Longer projects will by their nature take longer to produce in order to accommodate my other projects and personal obligations. If you do find yourself in dire need of immediate delivery, appropriate compensation can be negotiated.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Are you able to split recordings into multiple files? Or sync audio to a provided clip? Or proofread my script for grammatical errors or to adjust phrasings to make it read more naturally?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Of course! Many of these add-ons can be found on my Fiverr.com gig page, or requested as part of the bid phase. Please bear in mind that add-ons do carry a greater potential to increase the expected time to deliver.</p>
        </div>

        <button class="accordion">What if the recorded audio is not absolutely perfect to my liking?</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <p>Whenever I take on a project I consider the nature of taste, and the inevitable possibility that a full understanding of the expected delivery of a project has not been reached and therefore the audio provided does not meet expectations. With this in mind, I provide a single revision for free in nearly all of my project proposals and offers. Additional repetitive or extensive revisions will require adjustments to the agreed-upon price for services rendered.</p>
