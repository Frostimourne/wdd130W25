            <p id="bio_intro1">HI,</p>
            <p id="bio_intro2">I’m Jordan Michaelis, and I’m a voice actor. When I was but a lad sitting in English class one day, listening to a classroom of thirty diverse and unique boys and girls each read their assigned paragraphs almost identically, I ached in boredom. What could I do? I couldn’t force any of them to read more dynamically or dramatically any more than I could summon a jetpack and fly through the ceiling. But a thought soon formed in my mind. I counted ahead and found my paragraph, and I rehearsed it in my head, and read those four or five sentences with all the gusto an eleven year old could muster.</p>
            <p id="bio_p2">I was honestly pretty awful and probably quite annoying to my classmates that day, but I realized how much power we each hold in how we wield our voice, and since then I’ve cherished every opportunity to share mine with those around me – to buoy them up, to draw them in, to give them comfort amidst the storms of life. So please, join me for a moment, join me for a journey, join me for a memory.</p>
