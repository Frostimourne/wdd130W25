        Welcome!
      </h4>
      <p>
        HI,
I’m Jordan Michaelis, and I’m a voice actor.  When I was but a lad sitting in English class one day, listening to a classroom of thirty diverse and unique boys and girls each read their assigned paragraphs almost identically, I ached in boredom.  What could I do?  I couldn’t force any of them to read more dynamically or dramatically any more than I could summon a jetpack and fly through the ceiling.  But a thought soon formed in my mind.  I counted ahead and found my paragraph, and I rehearsed it in my head, and read those four or five sentences with all the gusto an eleven year old could muster.
I was honestly pretty awful and probably quite annoying to my classmates that day, but I realized how much power we each hold in how we wield our voice, and since then I’ve cherished every opportunity to share mine with those around me – to buoy them up, to draw them in, to give them comfort amidst the storms of life.  So please, join me for a moment, join me for a journey, join me for a memory.
      </p>
      <h4>
        My Journey
      </h4>
      <p>
        I began pursuing professional voice over about ten years ago.  Since then, I’ve voiced introductions for prestigious awards, advertisements for tech startups and World of Warcraft guilds, charitable book readings for local schools, and many a YouTube documentary or commentary video and channel.  Whether you need a smooth, comforting narration to fall asleep to, or an authoritative presence that exudes confidence, knowledge and understanding, consider me your one-stop-shop for dulcet baritone voice over.

      <h3>Samples and Demo</h3>
      <p>
        Don’t take my written word for it, have a listen for yourself! Below I have provided a number of samples and demos for you to listen to.  Take note of the differences in tone, delivery, and tempo.

      <h3>FAQ and Contact Me</h3>
      <p>
        Where are you located?
      </p>
      <p>
      I currently reside in the rocky mountains of Utah with my beautiful wife, darling daughter, and rascally rowdy dog
      </p>
      <p>
      Do you provide video recordings for hosted content?
      </p>
      <p>
      I currently provide audio only deliveries, as my home studio is not equipped for more than basic video calling from a cheap webcam
      </p>
      <p>
      How fast can you deliver my audio?  I need it yesterday!
      </p>
      <p>
      You can typically expect shorter projects (less than 1000 words) to be delivered within a few days.  Longer projects will by their nature take longer to produce in order to accommodate my other projects and personal obligations.  If you do find yourself in dire need of immediate delivery, appropriate compensation can be negotiated.
      </p>
      <p>
      What if the recorded audio is not absolutely perfect to my liking?
      </p>
      <p>
      Whenever I take on a project I consider the nature of taste, and the inevitable possibility that a full understanding of the expected delivery of a project has not been reached and therefore the audio provided does not meet expectations.  With this in mind, I provide a single revision for free in nearly all of my project proposals and offers.  Additional repetitive or extensive revisions will require adjustments to the agreed-upon price for services rendered.
      </p>
      <p>
      Are you able to split recordings into multiple files?  Or sync audio to a provided clip? Or proofread my script for grammatical errors or to adjust phrasings to make it read more naturally?
      </p>
      <p>
      Of course!  Many of these add-ons can be found on my Fiverr.com gig page, or requested as part of the bid phase.  Please bear in mind that add-ons do carry a greater potential to increase the expected time to deliver.
