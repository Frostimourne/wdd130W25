    <p>Hello-ello-ello everyone!  I'm so excited to be in this class with all of you this beautiful semester!  This is one of my final classes on what has become an almost ten year journey to get my bachelors (It's a long story, haha!), and I'm sure it's going to be great.  I live in northern Utah with my wonderful wife and daughter, and have been working for a construction company in their I.T. department.  It's been a wonderful place to learn more about what my classes have been teaching about and actually apply the lessons in a real world environment.</p>
    <p> When I'm not working or doing coursework, I enjoy playing games, spending time with friends and family, or recording music or voice over narrations on the side (I would love to do a full audiobook this year).  So here's to a great semester of Web Fundamentals!  Best of luck to all of you!</p>
